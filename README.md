# Test task
**This project tries to implement the lossless compression and decompression functions.** I implemented that with ~~ChatGPT~~ Huffman coding. 
The comresion rate is modest - only slightly above 10%.
**To run the project clone the project, install the requirements and run the _main.py_**
There's an _INPUT_PATH_ in the _main.py_ so feel free to insert your text file's name there. 
The script will generate {your text file's name}__compressed_ and {your text file's name}__compressed__decompressed_.txt files representing, well, archived input and extracted back output files.
